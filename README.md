Green Cars
====

Course project for the Coursera class Developing Data Products which uses the mtcars data set  

The slidify slides can be found [here](http://danieledavenport.github.io/cars/index.html)  

Note: it may not be apparent but, on the fourth slide, the data about the number of cars
and minimum/maximum/mean mpg are produced dynamically by R code.  
 
The shiny application can be found [here](http://ddavenport.shinyapps.io/Cars)
